    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>The effect of the curtailed train-service throughout the
    country is already observable. On certain sections of one of
    our Southern lines there are no trains running except those
    which started prior to January 1st.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The new Treasury Notes, we are told, are to have a picture
    of the House of Commons on the back. It is hoped that other
    places of amusement, such as the Crystal Palace and the
    Imperial Institute, will be represented on subsequent
    issues.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is announced from Germany that arrangements have been
    made whereby criminals are to be enrolled in the army. They
    have, of course, already conducted many of its operations.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to <i>The Daily Chronicle</i> there are only
    twenty-three full Generals in the British Army&mdash;a total
    identical with that of the late Cabinet. It is only fair to the
    army to state that the number is purely a coincidence.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p class="center">"THE RISE IN BOOT PRICES<br />
     WOMEN'S LARGE PURCHASES."</p>

    <p>The above headlines in a contemporary have caused a good
    deal of natural jealousy among members of the Force.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"At them and through them!" says the <i>Hamburger
    Fremdenblatt</i> in a seasonable message to the commander of
    the Turkish Navy. This will not deceive the Turk, who is
    beginning to realise that, while the invitation to go <i>at</i>
    the enemy is sincere, any opportunities of "going
    <i>through</i>" him will be exclusively grasped by his Teutonic
    ally.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Prince BUELOW has again arrived in Switzerland. It is these
    bold and dramatic strokes that lift the German diplomat above
    the ranks of the commonplace.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is explained by a railway official that a passenger who
    pays threepence for a ticket to-day is really only giving the
    company twopence, the rest being water, owing to the decline in
    the purchasing power of money. A movement is now on foot among
    some of the regular passengers to endeavour to persuade the
    companies to consent to take their fares neat for the
    future.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>At his Coronation the Emperor KARL OF AUSTRIA waved the
    sword of ST. STEPHEN towards the four corners of the earth, to
    indicate his intention to protect his empire against all its
    foes. The incident has been receiving the earnest consideration
    of the KAISER, who has now finally decided that in the
    circumstances it is not necessary to regard it as an unfriendly
    act.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It was felt that the ceremonies connected with the
    Coronation ought to be curtailed out of regard for the
    sufferings due to the War. So they dispensed with the customary
    distribution of bread to the poor.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Lecturing to a juvenile audience Professor ARTHUR KEITH said
    that there was no difference between detectives and scientists,
    and some of the older boys are still wondering whether he was
    trying to popularise science or to discredit detective
    stories.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Germans cannot now obtain footwear, it is reported, without
    a permit card. Nevertheless we know a number of them who are
    assured of getting the boot without any troublesome
    formalities.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Burglars have stolen eighteen ducks from the estate of
    BETHMANN-HOLLWEG. It will be interesting to note how their
    defence&mdash;that "Necessity knows no law"&mdash;is received
    by the distinguished advocate of the invasion of Belgium.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Taxicab drivers must expect a very low standard of
    intoxication to apply to them," said the Lambeth magistrate
    last week. On the other hand the police should be careful not
    to misinterpret the air of light-hearted devilry that endeared
    the "growler" to the hearts of an older generation.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is stated that &pound;2,250,000 has been sent by Germany
    into Switzerland to raise the exchanges. A much larger sum,
    according to Mr. PUTNAM, was sent into the United States merely
    to raise the wind.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Referring to the Highland regiments a <i>Globe</i> writer
    says, "The streets of London will reel with the music of the
    pipes when they come back." This is one of those obstacles to
    peace that has been overlooked by the KAISER.</p>

        "A subaltern friend of mine landed at Gibraltar for a few
        hours, and he was anxious to be able to say that he had
        been to Spain. So he walked along the Isthmus to Ceuta,
        where the British and Spanish sentries faced one another,
        and directly the Spanish soldier turned his head he hopped
        quickly over into Spain. Then the sentry turned round, and
        he hopped back again even more quickly."&mdash;<i>Daily
        Sketch.</i>

        "JAMES PHILLIPS, 16, was charged with doing damage to the
        extent of &pound;4 10s. at a refreshment shop in Hackney
        belonging to Peter Persico. As he was kept waiting a little
        time he broke a plate on the table; then he put a saucer
        under his heel and broke it. When remonstrated with he
        broke 10 cups and saucers by throwing them at partitions
        and enamelled decorations, and overturned a marble table,
        the top of which he smashed."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i>

    very popular in Hackney circles, "Persico's odi, puer,

    <h2>HEART-TO-HEART TALKS.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>The Emperor of AUSTRIA and Count
    TISZA</i>.)</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. So there is the full account, your Majesty, of
    men killed, wounded and captured.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. It is a gloomy list and I hardly can
    bear to consider it.</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. Yes, and beyond the mere list of casualties by
    fighting there are other matters to be considered. Food is
    scarce and of a poor quality, in Hungary as elsewhere. The
    armies we can yet feed, but the home-staying men and the women
    and children are a growing difficulty. It becomes more and more
    impossible to provide them with sufficient nourishment.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. It is strange, but in Austria the
    conditions are said to be even worse.</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. You are right, Sire, they are worse, much
    worse.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. Well, we must lose no time then. We must
    buy great stocks of food. More money must be spent.</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. More money? But where is it to come from? Not
    from Hungary, where we are within a narrow margin of financial
    collapse, and not in Austria, where there is already to all
    intents and purposes a state of bankruptcy. More money is not
    to be got, for we have none ourselves and nobody will lend us
    any.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. You paint the situation in dark colours,
    my friend TISZA.</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. I paint it as it is, Sire, at any rate as I
    see it. It is not the part of a Royal Counsellor to act
    otherwise.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. Yes, but there might be others who would
    take a different view, and support their belief with equally
    good reasons.</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. Not if they know the facts and are faithful to
    their duty as Ministers of the State. Here and there, no doubt,
    might be found foolish and ambitious men who would be willing
    to deceive, first themselves and then their Emperor, as to the
    true condition of affairs. But, if your Majesty trusted them
    and allowed them to guide you, you would learn too late how ill
    they had understood their duty. I myself, though determined to
    do everything in my power to promote the welfare of Hungary and
    its King, would willingly stand aside if you think that others
    would give you greater strength.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. I have every reason to trust you most
    fully. Have you any plan for extricating us from this dreadful
    morass of failure and difficulty into which we are plunged?</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. Your Majesty, there is only one way. We must
    have peace, and must have it as soon as possible.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor.</i> I too think we must have peace, but how
    shall we obtain it when we have a friend and ally who watches
    us with the closest care, and would not allow us even to hint
    at any steps that would really lead to peace?</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. Sire, you are a young man, but you are a scion
    of a great and ancient House, which was powerful and
    illustrious when the Hohenzollerns were but mean and petty
    barbarian princelings. Withdraw yourself, while the opportunity
    is still with you, from the fatal domination of this vain and
    inflated upstart who endeavours to serve only his own selfish
    designs. Our enemies will make peace with you, and thus he too
    will be forced to abandon the War. With him and with the deeds
    that have outraged the world they will not initiate any
    movement that tends to peace. He must go through his
    punishment, as indeed we all must, but his, I think, will be
    heavier than ours.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. Then you want me to make peace?</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. If it could be done by holding up your hand, I
    would urge you to hold it up at once.</p>

    <p><i>The Emperor</i>. And what would the world say?</p>

    <p><i>Tisza</i>. The world would glorify your name.</p>

    <h2>A KNIGHT-ERRANT.</h2>

    <p>Sister Baynes came into my room just as I was putting on my
    out-door uniform and wanted to know how I was spending my two
    hours off duty. She is full of curiosity about&mdash;she calls
    it interest in&mdash;other people's affairs. When I told her I
    was going out to buy a birthday present she looked rather
    stern. Said she:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"The giving of unnecessary presents has become a luxury
    which few of us nowadays think it right to afford."</p>

    <p>I didn't answer her because at the moment I could think of
    no really adequate reason why Bobbie <i>should</i> have a
    present, except that I so very much wanted to give him one.
    Bobbie is tall and young and red-haired and, of course, khaki
    clad. We are going to be married "when the War is over."</p>

    <p>I pondered Sister Baynes' words until I reached Oxford
    Street, and then forgot them in the interest of choosing the
    present. For a while I hesitated between cigarettes and
    chocolates, and finally decided on the latter. Bobbie is a
    perfect pig about sweets. I bought a comfortable-looking box,
    ornamented with a St. George, improbably attired in khaki,
    slaying a delightful German dragon clad in blue and a Uhlan
    helmet. St. George had red hair and a distinct look of Bobbie,
    which was one reason why I got him.</p>

    <p>This business accomplished, I thought I would call on a
    friend who lives near by. She is middle-aged and rather sad,
    and spends her time pushing trolleys about a munition works.
    Just now, however, I knew she had a cold and couldn't go out. I
    found her on the floor wrestling with brown paper, preparing a
    parcel for her soldier on Salisbury Plain. She adopted him
    through a League, and spends all her spare time and
    pocket-money in socks and cigarettes for him. She smiled at me
    wanly, with a piece of string between her teeth, and I felt I
    simply must do something to cheer her up.</p>

    <p>"I've brought you some chocolates for your cold," I said.
    "Eat one and forget the War and the weather," and I handed her
    Bobbie's box. Her necessity, as someone says somewhere, seemed
    at the moment so much greater than his.</p>

    <p>"You extravagant child!" she said, but her face lightened
    for an instant. She admired St. George almost as much as I had
    done, but, though she fingered the orange-coloured bow, she did
    not untie it, so I concluded she meant to have an orgy by
    herself later on. We talked for a while, and then I looked at
    the clock and fled for the hospital. She thanked me again for
    the chocolates as I went; she really seemed quite pleased with
    them.</p>

    <p>Two days later Matron collared me in the passage and gave me
    a handful of letters and things to distribute. There was a fat
    parcel for Martha, the ward-maid. I found her in the closet
    where she keeps her brooms, and gave it her. Her eyes simply
    danced as she took it, first carefully wiping her hand on her
    apron.</p>

    <p>"It's from my bruvver," she explained. "'Im on Salisbury
    Plain. Very good to me 'e always is." She stripped off the
    paper and gave a sigh of rapture. "Lor, Nurse, ain't it
    beautiful?"</p>

    <p>It was a chocolate box, a comfortable-looking chocolate box,
    ornamented with a red-headed St. George, a large blue dragon
    and a vivid orange bow.</p>

    <p>"It does seem nice," I agreed.</p>

    <p>"Fancy 'im spending all that on me," said Martha.</p>

    <p>"You'll be able to have quite a feast," said I, smiling at
    my old friend St. George.</p>

    <p>Martha looked suddenly shy.</p>

    <p>"I'm not going to keep it," she confided. She came closer to
    me. "Do you remember young Renshaw, what used to be in your
    ward, Nurse?"</p>

    <p>I nodded; I remembered him well, a cheery boy with a smashed
    leg, now in a Convalescent Home by the sea.</p>

    <p>"'Im and me's engaged," said Martha in a hoarse whisper. "I
    liked 'im and he liked me, and one day I was doing the windows
    'e asked me. 'E says the food down there is that monopolous, so
    I'll send him this 'ere just to cheer 'im up like."</p>

    <p>It seemed an excellent idea to me. I beamed upon Martha. I
    helped her to re-wrap St. George, and lent her my fountain-pen
    to write the address which was to send my Knight once more upon
    his travels. It appeared to me that he and his dragon were
    seeing a lot of life.</p>

    <p>Bobbie had arranged to call for me on his birthday, so when
    my off duty came I simply flung on my things and raced for the
    hall. As I passed Matron's door she called me in. I entered
    trembling; it was always a toss-up with Matron whether you were
    to be smiled upon or strafed.</p>

    <p>To-day she was lamb-like. She sat at a desk piled high with
    papers. Among them lay a vivid coloured object.</p>

    <p>"I've just had a letter from that young Renshaw," she said.
    "Such a charming letter, thanking us for all our kindness and
    enclosing a present to show his appreciation." She smiled. She
    seemed hugely pleased about something. "He addresses it to me,"
    she went on; "but, though I am grateful for the kind thought, I
    do not myself eat chocolates."</p>

    <p>She picked up the box, a comfortable-looking box ornamented
    with an orange satin bow.</p>

    <p>"I think these are more in your line than mine," she said,
    "and Renshaw was in your ward. You have really the best right
    to them."</p>

    <p>She handed me the box of chocolates. I gazed at my travelled
    Saint and he gazed back. I could almost have sworn he
    winked.</p>

    <p>Clutching him and his dragon, I departed and danced down the
    corridor into the hall. There waited Bobbie, red-haired and
    khaki-clad, more like St. George than the gallant knight
    himself.</p>

    <p>"How do you do?" I greeted him. "Many happy returns, dear
    old thing!" As he held out his hand I put something into it. "A
    box of chocolates," I explained; "I bought them for your
    birthday!"</p>

    <h2>THE REGIMENTAL MASCOT.</h2>

    <p>When his honour the Colonel took the owld rigiment to
    France, Herself came home bringin' the rigimental mascot with
    her. A big white long-haired billy-goat he was, the same.</p>

    <p>"I'll not be afther lavin him at the daypo," says Herself;
    "'tis no place for a domestic animal at all, the language them
    little drummer-boys uses, the dear knows," says she.</p>

    <p>So me bowld mascot he stops up at the Castle and makes free
    with the flower-beds and the hall and the drawin'-room and the
    domestic maids the way he'd be the Lord-Lieutenant o' the land,
    and not jist a plain human Angory goat. A proud arrygent
    crature it is, be the powers! Steppin' about as disdainy as a
    Dublin gerrl in Ballydehob, and if, mebbe, you'd address him
    for to get off your flower-beds with the colour of anger in
    your mouth he'd let a roar out of him like a Sligo piper with
    poteen taken, and fetch you a skelp with his horns that would
    lay you out for dead.</p>

    <p>And sorra the use is it of complainin' to Herself.</p>

    <p>"Ah, Delaney, 'tis the marshal sperit widin him," she'd say;
    "we must be patient with him for the sake of the owld
    rigiment;" and with that she'd start hand-feedin' him with
    warmed-up sponge-cake and playin' with his long silky hair.</p>

    <p>"Far be it from me," I says to Mikeen, the herd, "to
    question the workings o' Providence, but were I the Colonel of
    a rigiment, which I am not, and <i>had</i> to have a mascot,
    it's not a raparee billy I'd be afther havin', but a nanny, or
    mebbe a cow, that would step along dacently with the rigiment
    and bring ye luck, and mebbe a dropeen o' milk for the
    orficers' tea as well. If it's such cratures that bring ye
    fortune may I die a peaceful death in a poor-house," says
    I.</p>

    <p>"I'm wid ye," says Mikeen, groanin', he bein' spotted like a
    leopard with bruises by rason of him havin' to comb the
    mascot's silky hair twice daily, and the quick temper of the
    baste at the tangles.</p>

    <p>The long of a summer the billy stops up at the Castle,
    archin' his neck at the wurrld and growin' prouder and prouder
    by dint of the standin' he had with the owld rigiment and the
    high-feedin' he had from Herself. Faith, 'tis a great delight
    we servints had of him I'm tellin' ye! It was as much as your
    life's blood was worth to cross his path in the garden, and if
    the domestic maids would be meetin' him in the house they'd let
    him eat the dresses off them before they dare say a word.</p>

    <p>In the autumn me bowld mascot gets a wee trifle powerful by
    dint o' the high-feedin' and the natural nature of the crature.
    Herself, wid her iligant lady's nose, is afther noticin' it,
    and she sends wan o' the gerrls to tell meself and Mikeen to
    wash the baste.</p>

    <p>"There will be murdher done this day," says I to the lad,
    "but 'tis the orders&mdash;go get the cart-rope and the chain
    off the bull-dog, and we'll do it. Faith, it isn't all the
    bravery that's at the Front," says I.</p>

    <p>"That's the true wurrd," says he, rubbin' the lumps on his
    shins, the poor boy.</p>

    <p>"Oh, Delaney," says the domestic gerrl, drawin' a bottle
    from her apron pocket, "Herself says will ye plaze be so
    obligin' to sprinkle the mascot wid
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> a dropeen of this ody-koloney
       scent&mdash;mebbe it will quench his powerfulness, she
       says."</p>

    <p>I put the bottle in me pocket. We tripped up me brave goat
    with the rope, got the bull's collar and chain, and dragged him
    away towards the pond, him buckin' and ragin' between us like a
    Tyrone Street lady in the arms of the poliss. To hear the roars
    he let out of him would turn your hearts cowld as lead, but we
    held on.</p>

    <p>The Saints were wid us; in half-an-hour we had him as wet as
    an eel, and broke the bottle of ody-koloney over his back.</p>

    <p>He was clane mad. "God save us all when he gets that chain
    off him!" I says. "God save us it is!" says Mikeen, looking
    around for a tree to shin.</p>

    <p>Just at the minut we heard a great screechin' o' dogs, and
    through the fence comes the harrier pack that the Reserve
    orficers kept in the camp beyond. ("Harriers" they called them,
    but, begob! there wasn't anythin' they wouldn't hunt from a fox
    to a turkey, those ones.)</p>

    <p>"What are they afther chasin'?" says Mikeen.</p>

    <p>"'Tis a stag to-day, be the newspapers," I says, "but the
    dear knows they'll not cotch him this month, he must be gone by
    this half-hour, and the breath is from them, their tongues is
    hangin' out a yard," I says.</p>

    <p>'Twas at that moment the Blessed Saints gave me wisdom.</p>

    <p>"Mikeen," I says, "drag the mascot out before them; we'll
    see sport this day."</p>

    <p>"Herself&mdash;" he begins.</p>

    <p>"Hoult your whisht," says I, "and come on." With that we
    dragged me bowld goat out before the dogs and let go the
    chain.</p>

    <p>The dogs sniffed up the strong blast of ody-koloney and let
    a yowl out of them like all the banshees in the nation of
    Ireland, and the billy legged it for his life&mdash;small blame
    to him!</p>

    <p>Meself and Mikeen climbed a double to see the sport.</p>

    <p>"They have him," says Mikeen. "They have not," says I; "the
    crature howlds them by two lengths."</p>

    <p>"He has doubled on them," says Mikeen; "he is as sly as a
    Jew."</p>

    <p>"He is forninst the rabbit holes now," I says. "I thank the
    howly Saints he cannot burrow."</p>

    <p>"He has tripped up&mdash;they have him bayed," says
    Mikeen.</p>

    <p>And that was the mortal truth, the dogs had him.</p>

    <p>Oh, but it was a bowld billy! He went in among those hounds
    like a lad to a fair, you could hear his horns lambastin' their
    ribs a mile away. But they were too many for him and bit the
    grand silky hair off him by the mouthful. The way it flew you'd
    think it was a snowstorm.</p>

    <p>"They have him desthroyed," says Mikeen.</p>

    <p>"They have," says I, "God be praised!"</p>

    <p>At the moment the huntsman leps his harse up on the double
    beside us; he was phlastered with muck from his hair to his
    boots.</p>

    <p>"What have they out there?" says he, blinkin' through the
    mud and not knowin' rightly what his hounds were coursin' out
    before him, whether it would be a stag or a Bengal tiger.</p>

    <p>"'Tis her ladyship's Rile Imperial Mascot Goat," says I;
    "an' God save your honour for she'll have your blood in a
    bottle for this day's worrk."</p>

    <p>The huntsman lets a curse out of his stummick and rides
    afther them, flat on his saddle, both spurs tearin'. In the
    wink of an eye he is down among the dogs, larruppin' them with
    his whip and drawin' down curses on them that would wither ye
    to hear him&mdash;he had great eddication, that orficer.</p>

    <p>"Come now," says I to Mikeen, the poor lad, "let you and me
    bear the cowld corpse of the diseased back to Herself; mebbe
    she'll have a shillin' handy in her hand, the way she'd reward
    us for saving the body from the dogs," says I.</p>

    <p>But was me bowld mascot dead? He was not. He was alive and
    well, the thickness of his wool had saved him. For all that he
    had not a hair of it left to him, and when he stood up before
    you you wouldn't know him; he was that ordinary without his
    fleece, he was no more than a common poor man's goat, he was no
    more to look at than a skinned rabbit, and that's the
    truth.</p>

    <p>He walked home with meself and Mikeen as meek as a young
    gerrl.</p>

    <p>Herself came runnin' out, all fluttery, to look at him.</p>

    <p>"Ah, but that's not <i>my</i> mascot," says she.</p>

    <p>"It is, Marm," says I; and I swore to it by the whole
    Calendar&mdash;Mikeen too.</p>

    <p>"Bah! how disgustin'. Take it to the cow-house," says she,
    and stepped indoors without another word.</p>

    <p>We led the billy away, him hangin' his head for shame at his
    nakedness.</p>

    <p>"Ye'll do no more mascottin' avic," says I to him. "Sorra
    luck you would bring to a blind beggar-man the way you are
    now&mdash;you'll never step along again with the drums and
    tambourines."</p>

    <p>And that was the true word, for though Herself had Mikeen
    rubbing him daily with bear's-grease and hair-lotion he never
    grew the same grand fleece again, and he'd stand about in the
    back-field, brooding for hours together, the divilment clane
    gone out of his system; and if, mebbe, you'd draw the stroke of
    an ash-plant across his ribs to hearten him, he'd only just
    look at you sad-like and pass no remarks.</p>

    <h2>THE LITTLE RIFT.</h2>

    <p>My wife and I are in perfect agreement about everything. We
    are like the Allied Ministers who meet at Paris; we always
    "arrive at a complete understanding" in all matters of policy.
    When strict economy was enjoined upon us I moved my desk into
    the dining-room to save a fire. She made a summer hat out of a
    bit of my old Panama, encased in the remnants of an evening
    gown. All was well.</p>

    <p>I should be giving you a wrong impression altogether if I
    were to suggest that there was the slightest difference of
    opinion between us. I most solemnly declare that I am as good a
    patriot as she is. Still, as time goes on, I do feel a certain
    uneasiness, a suggestion of a new domestic element that needs
    watching.</p>

    <p>We are both in it, but the initiative rests with her. She
    asks me to take two Belgian refugees and the housemaid and the
    dog and the laundry-hamper along with me in the two-seater to
    the station, to save petrol. Well, I am willing. She fills the
    herbaceous border with alternating potatoes and carnations.
    Well, I am more than willing. She bottles peas and beans. And I
    say to you that I am proud and happy that she should think of
    these things.</p>

    <p>Above all she gets at the very root of the food problem. I
    should say that here she has advantages over some, as I belong
    to the class of husband known as Easily Fed. She has got hold
    of a whole sheaf of leaflets from the War Office or
    somewhere&mdash;"When is a pie not a pie?" "Leave out the egg;"
    "How to make something out of something else," etc., etc.; and
    we feed on those chiefly. She knows I don't like rabbits, and
    yet I am well aware that rabbits are repeatedly insinuated in
    such forms as not to leave a single clue. I cannot tell you how
    I admire and approve. Still it makes me thoughtful
    sometimes.</p>

    <p>No doubt you will believe that we are being drawn together
    by sharing these hardships. Well, yes. In a way. And yet I
    don't feel easy about it. We are quite in sympathy, but there
    is a difference in our point of view. Mine, I affirm, is the
    nobler. I economize, although I loathe it; while she, I am
    convinced, is beginning to like it. I don't mean to say that
    she does it on purpose, but that phrase may give you an idea
    what I mean. I sometimes wonder wistfully if the hand that put
    that ugly new steel contraption at the back of the fire to save
    the coal is really the hand that I wooed and won ten years ago.
    I see in her the steady growth of an implacable conscience. In
    moments of depression I have a horrid feeling that she always
    wanted to do this sort of thing and never got a real chance
    till now.</p>

    <p>We were extraordinarily happy before the War. We were not at
    all hard up and we had no compunctions about spending money.
    But now&mdash;I wonder how long the War will last? What
    I am afraid of is the formation of habits. I am already
    guarding against it by talking about all the things that we are
    going to do after the War. She quite agrees with me about them,
    but she isn't enthusiastic. I put my claims pretty high. The
    garden is to be reconstructed, and I am adding a wing to the
    house. We are going to travel first, and I am not sure that we
    shan't have a new cook. And we are to have an Airedale and an
    Axminster, and a Stilton and a new Panama.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact that is all bluff on my part. I only
    want to have something in hand to bargain with. If I can ever
    get back to the <i>status quo ante</i> I will not ask for
    annexations.</p>

    <p>Well, that is how it is. Most eagerly do I fall in with her
    latest suggestion that I should let her clean my flannel suit
    with benzine (I don't like the smell of it) instead of getting
    a new one. Only I live in a growing fear that the day when
    peace is signed in Europe will be the signal for an outbreak of
    a new form of warfare in our happy home.</p>

    <h2>WHAT DID MR. ASQUITH DO?</h2>

    <p>A famous story tells how a heckler once broke up a Liberal
    meeting by asking with raucous iteration, "What did Mr.
    GLADSTONE say in 1878?" or whatever year it was. Nobody knew,
    and neither did the inquirer himself, but uproar followed and
    his end was achieved. Now had the question run, "What did Mr.
    GLADSTONE do?" how different a result! For Mr. GLADSTONE, apart
    from any trifles of statesmanship or legislation, did two
    priceless things, as I will show.</p>

    <p>Although, writes the Returned Traveller who in our last
    number was so unhappy about the deterioration that has come
    upon taxi-drivers, I left England only in October last, I find
    it a changed place; but no change, not even the iniquitous
    prices demanded by London's restaurateurs, or the increased
    darkness, or the queer division of <i>hors d'oeuvres</i> into
    half-courses and whole-courses (providing an answer at last to
    the pathetic query, "What is a sardine?" "A whole course, of
    course")&mdash;no change is so striking as the fact that when a
    paper now refers to the PRIME MINISTER or the PREMIER, it means
    no longer HERBERT HENRY but DAVID. In a world of flux and
    mutability I had come to think of Mr. ASQUITH as a rock, a
    pyramid, a pole-star. But, alas! even he was subject to
    alteration.</p>

    <p>Thinking earnestly upon his career I have realised bow sad
    it is that he has bequeathed us no ASQUITH legend. Always
    reserved and intent, he discouraged Press gossip to such a
    degree as actually to have turned the key on the Tenth Muse.
    Everybody else might lunch at the hospitable board in Downing
    Street, but interviewers had no chance. In vain did the Quexes
    of this frivolous city hope for even a crumb&mdash;there was
    nothing for them. Mr. ASQUITH came into office, held it, and
    left it without a single concession to Demos's love of
    personalia. He did not even wear comic collars or white hats or
    a single eyeglass or any other grotesquely significant thing;
    and how much poorer are we in consequence and how much poorer
    will posterity be!</p>

    <p>Contrast the case of Mr. GLADSTONE, from whom anyone could
    draw a postcard and most people a chip of some recently-felled
    tree, and who is in my mind wonderful and supreme by reason of
    two inventions which, though no one would ever guess them to be
    the result of a Prime Minister's cogitations, deserve the
    widest fame. Of these one was the product of his unaided
    genius; the other the result of the collaboration with his
    wife.</p>

    <p>Let us begin with the individual triumph.</p>

    <p>Everyone who has ever stayed under anyone else's roof, from
    a dine-and-sleep at Windsor Castle to a week in lovely Lucerne,
    has been confronted, when packing-up time arrived, with the
    problem of the sponge. No matter how muscular the fingers that
    wring this article, no matter how thick and costly the rubbered
    receptacle that holds it, there is always the chance of
    dampness communicating itself to other things in the bag. Isn't
    there?</p>

    <p>How so to squeeze the sponge as to drive out the last drop
    of moisture was the problem before the massive intellect of the
    Grand Old Man. Need I say that he solved it? His method, as he
    himself in his unselfish way, told one of the diarists,
    possibly Sir M.E. GRANT-DUFF, possibly Mr. G.W.E.
    RUSSELL&mdash;I forget whom&mdash;was to wrap up the sponge in
    a bath-towel and jump on it. Here, for the historical painter,
    is a theme indeed&mdash;something worth all the ordinary dull
    occasions which provoke his talented if somewhat staid brush:
    the great Liberal statesman, the promoter of Home Rule, the
    author of <i>The Impregnable Rock of Holy Scripture</i>,
    leaping upon the bath-towel that held his sponge. But no
    historical painter could do justice to such a scene. It needs
    the movies.</p>

    <p>Those of us then who dry our sponges in this way&mdash;and I
    am a fervent devotee&mdash;owe the inventor a meed of praise.
    And equally those of us who put into our hot water bottles at
    night hot tea instead of hot water (as I never have done and
    never mean to do), so that, waking in the small hours, we may
    yet not be without refreshment, owe a meed of praise to the
    same inspired innovator, for, if the chroniclers are correct,
    it was Mrs. GLADSTONE'S habit to retire to rest with a bottle
    thus nutritiously filled, which would be ready for her great
    man on his return from the House weary and athirst.</p>

    <p>Here we see the difference between Liberal Premiers. For
    what has Mr. ASQUITH done towards the solution of domestic
    problems? Who can name a thing? Has he devised a collar stud
    that cannot be lost? Has he hit upon a way instantly to stop a
    shaving cut from bleeding? Has he contrived a taxi window that
    will open when shut or shut when open? No. In all these years
    he has spared no time for any inventions.</p>

    <p>No wonder then that he was found wanting and forced to
    resign.</p>

    <h2>WARS OF THE PAST.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>As recorded in the Press of the period.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>VI.</h4>

    <h4><i>From "The Athens Advertiser and Pir&aelig;us
    Post</i>."</h4>

    <h4>MACEDONIA'S ARMY.</h4>

    <h4>THE FAMOUS PHALANX.</h4>

    <h4>(<i>By our Military Expert</i>.)</h4>

    <p>The Macedonian Army has recently undergone an entire
    reconstruction at the hands of KING PHILIP. It is now organised
    on a national and territorial basis and is divided into
    infantry and cavalry. The cavalry predominates and is therefore
    the stronger arm. The unit of cavalry is the squadron, of
    infantry the battalion. (It is of the utmost interest to note
    that there are two battalions in a regiment, each about fifteen
    hundred strong).</p>

    <p>KING PHILIP, it will be remembered, received his military
    education in the school of EPAMINONDAS, who, as is well known,
    revolutionised the Higher Thought of every Higher Command by
    the discovery and application of a single tactical
    fact&mdash;namely, that the chances of A being able to give B a
    stronger push than B can give him are <i>in direct ratio to the
    numerical superiority of A over B</i>. It follows, then, that,
    faced with a sufficient superiority, B <i>must</i> retire, and
    <i>the initiative then rests with the side that possesses
    it</i>.</p>

    <p>In pursuance of this tactical ideal EPAMINONDAS argued that
    the old method of winning battles, which was that A should
    exercise superior force against every point of B's line (or
    body), required that A should be bigger than B, buskin for
    buskin and brisket for brisket. But since it is sufficient,
    while "refusing" the rest of one's own body (or line), to bring
    an overwhelming force to bear on the point of a person's jaw,
    in order to discomfit him, so in a battle a numerically
    inferior A, by concentrating on a vital point of numerically
    superior B, can gain a local numerical superiority which will
    enable him to rout B utterly. (This is always supposing that B
    is not doing the same thing himself on the other wing, in which
    case each army would miss the other altogether&mdash;a
    condition of things into which the military art does not care
    to follow them).</p>

    <p>Hence the phalanx or "preponderating mass formation." The
    Macedonian development of this depends (to reduce the matter to
    the simple algebraical formula to which all military problems
    are susceptible) on the fact that if <i>x</i> equals the
    greatest efficiency of an army, and the rooted square of
    stability to the <i>n</i>th rank equals the phalanx, then the
    rooted square of stability to the <i>n</i>th rank equals
    <i>x</i> minus the tangential curve of velocity of mobility.
    This should be plain even to the amateur student of tactics.
    Blending almost a military expert's appreciation of this
    cardinal doctrine with his natural selfishness as a leader of
    cavalry, PHILIP has given to this, the mobile arm, much of the
    striking power of the original phalanx. This is now placed in
    the centre, its business being mainly to force a salient in the
    enemy's line, the two resultant enclaves of which can then be
    shattered (at their re-entrants) by the cavalry squadrons,
    hurled forward on both phalanks. It should be noted, as a
    brilliant example of PHILIP'S staff work, that in the
    Macedonian Army, for the avoidance of confusion in the field,
    "phalanks" is now spelt "flanks."</p>

    <p>To the intelligent student who has followed me thus far in
    these articles it should not be necessary to explain again the
    terms "enclave," "salient," and "re-entrant." "Tactical" is a
    term used when one is not using the term "strategical," and
    <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

    <h2>THE ONLY STEGGLES.</h2>

    <p>Steggles is my groom, and my crowning mercy. But for his
    deafness I am sure he would long since have left the humble
    rank of gunner far beneath him, and the Staff might have gained
    a brilliant strategist. In addition to dulness of hearing,
    Steggles is endowed&mdash;I should indeed be ungrateful to use
    the word afflicted&mdash;with a vacuity of expression which
    puts rivals or antagonists off their guard, and doubles his
    value during the vicissitudes of active service. What would be
    handicaps to ordinary men Steggles turns to the advantage of
    himself, Sapphira my mare, and me.</p>

    <p>When on the march the Battery arrives at the morass allotted
    to it for horse lines, I know that all will be well with the
    mud-bespattered Sapphira. Steggles leaps from the waggon
    whereon, in company with one of the cooks, he tours the
    pleasant land of France, and receives the mare. With his toes
    strangely pointed out, he leads her away from the scene of
    labour and language, disappearing amidst the hovels of the
    adjacent village. Often I never see him or obtain news of him
    till next morning, when he produces Sapphira polished like a
    silk hat and every scrap of metal about her sparkling.
    Occasionally I have tracked him to the shelter where he
    secretes and waits upon Sapphira, always to find that he has
    discovered and occupied the best stable in the village. The
    grooms of my brother-officers never learn that Steggles'
    vacuous expression is the disguise of an intellect subtle,
    discriminating and alert, so they never trouble to endeavour to
    forestall him. To find Sapphira is to find Steggles, as he
    always likes to spread his blanket where she could tread on him
    if she wanted anything during the night.</p>

    <p>From time to time he chooses the occasion of a night's halt
    on the march to indulge in a bilious attack; but he has no
    other vice except an inveterate reluctance to leave off
    polishing my boots when I mount. No matter how Sapphira may
    prance and back and sidle, he follows her round and round with
    a remnant of a shirt, rubbing mud-spots off my boots in the
    stirrup. It is quite useless to bellow, "That will do,
    Steggles!"&mdash;his ideal is the unattainable perfection, and
    he persists. I have to escape by giving Sapphira the spur at
    the risk of knocking Steggles into the mud, or be late in
    turning out.</p>

    <p>He never gives anything, even his own performances,
    unqualified praise; in fact it is extremely hard to win from
    him any encomium higher than "It's not too bad." Perhaps there
    is Scotch blood in his veins.</p>

    <p>I very much want to recommend him for some decoration, but
    the organization likely to appreciate the most gallant of his
    deeds has not yet been formed&mdash;the S.P.G.P., or Society
    for the Preservation of Government Property.</p>

    <p>Steggles was once riding behind me down a valley liberally
    dimpled with shell-holes, further dimples being in process of
    formation as we rode. I was returning from an O Pip, or
    Observation Post, and Steggles was carrying a pair of my boots
    with a rolled puttee stuffed into each. Suddenly I was aware
    that he had wheeled his horse about, and was trotting back
    towards the most dimply area of the valley. Out of regard for
    his family, I cantered after him. He broke into a gallop. When,
    after a thrilling ride, I caught him and had a little talk
    amongst the dimples, it appeared that he had dropped one of the
    puttees, and wished to return and look for it. This incident
    will, I think, demonstrate the exceptional character of the
    man, who did not appear to regard himself as a hero, or to pose
    as a desperate <i>farceur</i>, or to aspire to the post of
    Q.M.S., though, incredible as it may seem, the puttee in
    question was of the variety G.S.</p>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</h4>

    <p>To those who would learn what soldiering is like in the
    armies of democratic France I would heartily commend two books
    recently published by Messrs. ALLEN AND UNWIN, <i>Battles and
    Bivouacs</i>, by JACQUES ROUJON, and <i>The Diary of a French
    Private</i>, by GASTON RIOU. M. ROUJON, infantryman of the
    line, was in private life a journalist on <i>Le Figaro</i>; M.
    RIOU, Red Cross orderly, a liberal lay-theologian and writer of
    European reputation. The former's transliterator ("Munitions
    are distributed around," writes he undismayed; and has also
    discovered a territory known as "Oriental Prussia") obtrudes a
    little between author and reader. M. RIOU fares better; but
    both contrive to give a really vivid impression of the horrors
    and anxieties of the early days of the War before the tide
    turned at the Marne, of the flying rumours so far from the
    actual truth, of the fine spirit of <i>camaraderie</i> in
    common danger, of the intimate relations between officers and
    men, details, terrible or trivial, of campaigning, and, because
    our spirited brothers-in-arms are not ashamed to express their
    innermost feelings, of the deeper emotions at work under the
    surface gaieties. M. RIOU'S narrative is mainly the record of
    his year's captivity in a Bavarian fort. On his way he faced
    the fanatical hatred and cruelty of the German civilians, of
    the women especially, with a cynical fortitude. The commandant
    of his prison, Baron von STENGEL, was, however, a gentleman and
    a brick, and did everything in his power to make the difficult
    life bearable. An episode pleasant to recall is the reception
    of the Russian prisoners (intended by their captors to cause
    dissensions) by their French comrades in misfortune. The whole
    record gives an impression of fine courage and
    resourcefulness.</p>

    <p>Very probably you are already acquainted with that restful
    and admirable book, <i>Father Payne</i> (SMITH, ELDER), of
    which a new edition has just now been published. The point of
    this new edition is that, in its special Preface, the genesis
    and authorship of the book are assigned, for the first time on
    this side the Atlantic, to Mr. A.C. BENSON. And the point of
    the new preface is that it entirely gives away the original
    edition (also printed here), in which the secret was
    elaborately concealed. My wonder is, reading the book with this
    added knowledge, that anyone can have at any time failed to
    detect in it the gently persuasive hand of the Master of
    Magdalene, Cambridge. You remember, no doubt, how <i>Father
    Payne</i> (a courtesy title), having had a small estate left to
    him, proceeded to turn it into the home of a secular community
    for young men desirous of pursuing the literary gift, and how
    he financed, encouraged and generally supervised them. Leisure,
    an exquisite setting, and the society of enthusiastic and
    personally-selected youth&mdash;one might call the book perhaps
    a Tutor's Dream of the Millennium. Anyhow, <i>Father Payne</i>,
    as shown in this volume, which is practically a record of his
    table-talk <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span> upon a great variety of
       themes, is exactly the gentle, shrewd and idealistic
       philosopher whom (knowing his parentage) one would expect.
       Bensonians (of the A.C. pattern) will certainly be glad to
       have what must surely have been their suspicions confirmed,
       and to admit <i>Father Payne</i> to the shelves of
       authenticity.</p>

    <p>Miss DOROTHEA CONYERS has long ere this established herself
    as a specialist of repute in Irish sporting tales. You will
    need but one look at the picture wrapper of <i>The Financing of
    Fiona</i> (ALLEN) to see that a repetition of the same
    agreeable mixture awaits you within. <i>Fiona</i> was a
    charming young woman (Irish, of course) with a rich uncle and a
    poor, very unattractive cousin, who loved her for her
    expectations. As <i>Fiona</i> had no conception about money
    beyond the spending of it, the uncle made a will, whose object
    was that she should have plenty. The suitor, however, knowing
    of this, and being a naughty, rather improbable person,
    destroyed part of it, with the result that <i>Fiona</i> was
    apparently left only the ancestral home and no cash to keep it
    up. So she was forced to take in gentleman boarders for the
    hunting, and (for propriety's sake) to invent a mythical
    chaperon, who lived above stairs. And, after all, she needn't
    have done any such thing, because the rich uncle, in leaving
    her all the contents of the mansion, had foolishly forgotten to
    mention a secret drawer full of Canadian securities. As for the
    villain, I really hardly dare tell you the impossibly silly way
    in which he allowed himself to be caught out. But of course all
    this melodrama is not what matters. The important thing about
    Miss CONYERS' people is that (whatever their private worries)
    a-hunting they will go; and <i>Fiona</i>, financed by her
    paying guests, shows in this respect as capital sport as any of
    her predecessors. For the rest, I can hardly say with honesty
    that the story is equal to its author's best form.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>What I like particularly about Mr. FREDERICK NIVEN is the
    friendly way in which he contrives to make his readers and
    himself into a family party. "We must," he writes at the
    beginning of a chapter in <i>Cinderella of Skookum Greek</i>
    (NASH), "get a move on with the story, in case you become more
    tired of Archer's compound fracture than he was himself." This
    is by no means the only occasion on which he shows his
    thoughtfulness for us, and I think it very kind and nice of
    him. At the same time I will ungraciously admit that the weak
    point of his story is that it does not move quite fast enough.
    Admirable artist in psychology and atmosphere, his plot, if you
    can call it a plot, is very slight. <i>Cyrus Archer</i>, the
    young American of the compound fracture (who had my sympathy
    from the start because he could never remember dates), goes out
    into the back of beyond for a spell before settling down to
    married life and a place in his father's business, and at
    Skookum Creek, where he grows tomatoes and studies Indians, he
    meets his <i>Cinderella</i>, with the result that his life has
    to be completely rearranged. A commonplace tale, but there is a
    rare and distinct flavour about the telling of it. Mr. NIVEN'S
    manner has indeed a very particular charm, over which one would
    take an even keener pleasure in lingering if only he himself
    lingered a little less over his story.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I hardly think that Madame ALBANESI has chosen quite the
    most appropriate name for the story that she calls <i>Hearts
    and Sweethearts</i> (HUTCHINSON). Personally, I fancy that
    <i>Suits and Lawsuits</i> would have come nearer the mark;
    because, though there is a certain proportion of love-making in
    the tale, there is considerably more about going to law. One
    difficulty with which I fancy the writer had to contend is due
    to the fact that her hero and heroine are (in a sense) the
    opposing protagonists in a case of disputed succession;
    <i>Jemima Frant</i> being engaged in the attempt to turn out
    <i>Sir John Norminster</i> from his estates and establish the
    claim to them of her dead sister's child. Naturally, therefore,
    till this is settled their opportunities for the tender passion
    are, to put it very gently, restricted. But of
    course&mdash;well, a novel with such a title is hardly likely
    to leave anybody of importance unmarried at the final page.
    Before this is turned, you have some pleasant comedy of London
    in war-time, and meet a number of agreeably sketched persons,
    whose conversation may amuse you, or, on the other hand, may
    cause you to wish them a little less discursive. Madame
    ALBANESI indeed impressed me as having occasionally turned her
    subordinate characters loose into a chapter, with instructions
    to fill it up anyhow, while she herself thought out the next
    move. But the law was always leisurely, so this characteristic
    might perhaps be expected in a story so much concerned with
    it.</p>

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
